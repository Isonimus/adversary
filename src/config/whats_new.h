/**
 * @file whats_new.h
 * @brief Bundled "what's new" notes for the running release (ADR-0121, slice-0122).
 *
 * Hand-curated, operator-pitched summary of what changed in the version now running. This
 * is NOT generated from CHANGELOG.md: the on-device copy is deliberately terser and more
 * operator-facing, and generating it would couple the build to changelog markup for no gain.
 *
 * RELEASE CHECKLIST: when VERSION is bumped, rewrite these lines for the new release in the
 * same commit (see CLAUDE.md). The title line is composed as "v<config::VERSION> - <line 0>",
 * so line 0 is the release CODENAME only (e.g. "FIELD USABILITY"): do not put the version
 * number anywhere in the body. Keep it to roughly a screenful (~34 chars/line).
